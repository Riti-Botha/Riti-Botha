### Understanding Resistance Calculation

1. **Ohm's Law**: Resistance \( R \) is defined as the ratio of voltage \( V \) across a component to the current \( I \) flowing through it:
   \[ R = \frac{V}{I} \]

2. **Voltage Consideration**:
   - **External Voltage \( V \)**: This is the voltage specifically applied across the resistor. It represents the potential difference that drives the current through the resistor.
   - **Emf \( \mathcal{E} \)**: Emf is the total voltage output of the source, which includes any voltage drops across internal resistances within the source itself.

### Why External Voltage \( V \)?

- **Direct Relationship**: The resistance \( R \) of a resistor depends on the voltage \( V \) directly applied across it and the resulting current \( I \) that flows through it. This \( V \) is the voltage that the resistor actually experiences.
  
- **Ohm's Law Application**: Ohm's law \( R = \frac{V}{I} \) requires using the actual voltage \( V \) across the resistor to determine its resistance.

### Emf vs External Voltage \( V \)

- **Emf \( \mathcal{E} \)**: Represents the total potential difference provided by a source. It includes the voltage drop across any internal resistance \( r \) of the source itself when current is flowing.
  
- **Use Case**: When calculating the resistance \( R \) of a resistor, you are interested in the specific voltage \( V \) that drives the current through the resistor. This \( V \) is the external voltage directly applied to the resistor.

### Example Scenario

- **Resistor Calculation**: If you have a resistor connected across a battery with emf \( \mathcal{E} \) and internal resistance \( r \), and you measure \( V \) across the resistor when current \( I \) flows, you use \( V \) in \( R = \frac{V}{I} \).

- **Impact of Internal Resistance**: Internal resistance \( r \) affects the total voltage \( \mathcal{E} \) supplied by the battery and the voltage drop across its terminals under load. However, for the resistor itself, you focus on the voltage directly applied across it.

### Summary

- **Resistance Calculation**: Use the external voltage \( V \) across the resistor to calculate its resistance \( R \) using Ohm's law \( R = \frac{V}{I} \).
- **Emf vs External Voltage**: Emf (total source voltage) includes internal resistances and is not directly used to calculate the resistance of a specific resistor connected to the source.

Therefore, when calculating the resistance a resistor gives, you use the external voltage \( V \) because it directly reflects the potential difference across the resistor and is essential for applying Ohm's law to determine \( R \).
